INFO 10-21 19:49:43 model_runner.py:1434] Capturing cudagraphs for decoding. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, and 3 cups of mixed feed per chicken per day. So, she gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in total. Since her flock is 20 chickens, she needs to give them 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed in total. Since she already gave them 40 cups, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.
Answer:
20

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. The third glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3, and so on. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $

Answer:
100
________________________________________________________________________________

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, which is 180 miles. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn’t cover any distance during that time. He spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph, which is 15 miles. He spends the remaining 2 hours driving at 80 mph, which is 160 miles. So, he covers a total of 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.
Answer:
355
________________________________________________________________________________

Answer:
100
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate the total distance John drove: 180 miles + 0 miles (during the standstill traffic) + 0 miles (during the 0.5 hour drive at 30 mph) + 120 miles (during the 1.5 hour drive at 80 mph) = 300 miles.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, which is 180 miles. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn’t cover any distance during that time. He spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph, which is 15 miles. He spends the remaining 2 hours driving at 80 mph, which is 160 miles. So, he covers a total of 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.
Answer:
355
________________________________________________________________________________

Answer:
100
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
So, John drove 180 miles in the first 3 hours, 0 miles in the 2 hours of traffic, 0 miles in the 0.5 hours of driving at 30 mph, and 120 miles in the 1.5 hours of driving at 80 mph.
Answer:
180 + 0 + 0 + 120 = 300 miles

Answer:
300

The merchant has two options: 1) buy jewelry worth $5,000 and 2) buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000. Let’s calculate the profit for each option:
Option 1:
Profit = (Jewelry value at the end of the month) - (Jewelry value at the beginning of the month)
Profit = ($5,000 * 1.025) - ($5,000)
Profit = $5,125 - $5,000
Profit = $125

Option 2:
Profit = (Electronic gadgets value at the end of the month) - (Electronic gadgets value at the beginning of the month)
Profit = ($8,000 * 1.012) - ($8,000)
Profit = $8,080 - $8,000
Profit = $80

Answer:
The merchant would make a profit of $80 if he chooses to buy electronic gadgets.

Let’s calculate the profit for each option: 1) If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will be $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125. The merchant will make a profit of $5,125 - $5,000 = $125. 2) If the electronic gadgets market goes up 1.2%, the value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096. The merchant will make a profit of $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.
Answer:
The merchant would make a profit of $125 if he chooses to buy jewelry and $96 if he chooses to buy electronic gadgets.

First, I have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. So, it contains 10 * (2/3) = 10/3 = 3.33 liters of water. Then, I have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. So, it contains 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters of water. When I pour it together, I spill one liter of the orange drink, so I have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 3.33 + 9 + 9 = 21.33 liters.
Answer:
21.33

________________________________________________________________________________

The orange drink has 10 liters and is two-thirds water, so it contains 10 * (2/3) = 10/3 = 3.33 liters of water. The pineapple drink has 15 liters and is three-fifths water, so it contains 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters of water. When I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink, so I am left with 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run 4 times as far as she can walk in the same amount of time. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can walk at 3/4 of that speed, which is 3/4 * 3 = 2.5 miles per hour. In six hours, she can walk 2.5 * 6 = 15 miles. She can run 4 times as far as she can walk, so she can run 4 * 15 = 60 miles. In six hours, she can travel 60 + 15 = 75 miles.

75

________________________________________________________________________________

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run at 4 * 3 = 12 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running, she will run for 12 / 3 = 4 hours. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she will walk for 4 / 2 = 2 hours. So, in six hours, she will travel 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

6

300g of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 250 = 1250 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target of 2000 calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram of chips: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

300g of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 250 = 1250 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target of 2000 calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram of chips: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how many pounds of beeswax he needs to make 20 candles: 20 / 10 = 2 pounds. Next, let’s calculate the cost of the supplies: 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00. Next, let’s calculate the revenue from selling the candles: 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00. Finally, let’s calculate his net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

[rank0]:[W1021 20:39:51.792299362 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
