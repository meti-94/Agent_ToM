To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $<<16*5=80>>80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $<<16*0.6=9.6>>9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $<<80+9.6=89.6>>89.6.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $<<16*5=80>>80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $<<16*0.6=9.6>>9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $<<80+9.6=89.6>>89.6.

89.6

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (in traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 1.5 hours: 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, John is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Answer:
100
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (in traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 1.5 hours: 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, John is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour: 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours: 2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles.
So, John is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it had 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, so it had 180 - (180 * 0.3) = 126 downloads. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, add the number of downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
Answer:
366

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is 5 / 3 ≈ 1.67. Since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 2 vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 1 vacuum cleaner. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 1 / 2 = 0.5. Again, since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner. This leaves her with 0 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

5

Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 students - 4 students (contemporary) - 4 students (jazz) = 4 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (4 students / 20 students) * 100 = 20%.
Answer:
20%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can find this by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance: 16 * 25% = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%
Answer:

________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can find this by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance: 75% of 16 (the remaining students after contemporary dance) = 12 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 100% - 4 - 12 = 4 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%.
