To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. The third glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3, and so on. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $

First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333.33 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, she downloads 333.33 GB / 2 = 166.67 GB in 166.67 minutes. After the restart, she has to download the same amount of data again, which takes 166.67 minutes. So, the total time to download the file is 166.67 + 166.67 = 333.34 minutes.

40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the total time to download the file is 166.67 minutes (before the restart) + 166.67 minutes (after the restart) = 333.34 minutes.

333.34

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 miles.
2. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. 
3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = <<0.5*30=15>>15 miles.
4. He spends the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph, so he covers 4 - 2 - 0.5 = <<4-2-0.5=1.5>>1.5 hours * 80 = <<1.5*80=120>>120 miles.
5. In total, John covers 180 + 15 + 120 = <<180+15+120=315>>315 miles.

Answer:
315 miles

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = 180 miles.
2. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
4. He spends the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph, so he covers 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours * 80 = 120 miles.
5. In total, John covers 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

Answer:
315 miles

1. The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
2. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 downloads.
3. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% in the second month, so it was 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads.
4. The total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366 downloads.

Answer:
366

1. The program had 60 downloads in the first month. 2. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 3. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% in the second month, so it was 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads. 4. The total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it had 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, so it had 180 - (180 * 0.3) = 126 downloads. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the number of downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

________________________________________________________________________________

Let’s start with the green house. If Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, she sold 1/3 of 5 = 1.67. Since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 2 vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners.
Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. This leaves her with 1 vacuum cleaner.
Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 1 vacuum cleaner left, she sold 1/2 of 1 = 0.5. Again, since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner.
So, Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners.
Answer:
5
________________________________________________________________________________

Let’s start with the green house. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, so she sold 5 / 3 = 1.67. Since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 2 vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners. Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, leaving her with 1 vacuum cleaner. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 1 / 2 = 0.5. Again, since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner. This leaves her with 0 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 students (20 - 4) is. 20% of 16 is 0.20 * 16 = 3.2
Since we can’t have a fraction of a student, we round up to 4 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students
Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. This means that 12 students did not enroll in jazz dance.
Since the remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16
25% of the remaining: 16 * 0.25 = 4
So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 12 / 20 = 0.6
To convert this to a percentage: 0.6 * 100 = 60%

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 (20 - 4) is. 20% of 16 is 0.20 * 16 = 3.2
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to 3 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 - 3 = 13
Therefore, 13 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.
13 / 20 = 0.65
0.65 x 100 = 65%

1. The merchant has two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000.
2. The financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month.
3. To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option that will give him the highest profit at the end of the month.
4. To calculate the profit, we need to find the difference between the final value of the item and the initial value of the item.
5. For the jewelry, the final value will be $5,000 * 1.025 = $<<5000*1.025=5125>>5,125.
6. For the electronic gadgets, the final value will be $8,000 * 1.012 = $<<8000*1.012=8096>>8,096.
7. Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option that will give him the highest profit at the end of the month.
8. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, and he will make a profit of $8,096 - $8

1. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
2. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.
3. So, she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<35*50=1750>>1750 hours/year as a teacher.
4. She works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<15*50=750>>750 hours/year as a coach.
5. Therefore, her annual salary is 1750 hours/year * $20/hour + 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $<<1750*20+750*30=7000>>7000.

 Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  In 4 weeks, she will make 4 weeks * 3 eggs per week = <<4*3=12>>12 egg omelets.  Since each egg omelet contains 3 eggs, she will eat 12 egg omelets * 3 eggs per omelet = <<12*3=36>>36 eggs in 4 weeks.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she will eat 36 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = <<36/12=3>>3 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

3

 Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  In 4 weeks, she will make 4 weeks * 3 eggs per week = <<4*3=12>>12 egg omelets.  Since each egg omelet contains 3 eggs, she will eat 12 egg omelets * 3 eggs per omelet = <<12*3=36>>36 eggs in 4 weeks.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she will eat 36 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = <<36/12=3>>3 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs x $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box to find how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered:
Cost of one box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs x $3 = $15
Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid:
$50 - $33 = $17
Now, we can divide the $17 by the cost of each box of pizza to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered:
$17 / $8.50 = 2

Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box to find how many boxes Marie ordered:
Cost of each box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

Let x be the cost of the boots. Then the cost of the two pairs of high heels is x - 5. The cost of one pair of heels is $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the other pair of heels is 2 \* $33 = $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $99, the cost of the two pairs of high heels is $99 - $5 = $94.

7:11 is the ratio of their ages. If their total age now is 162, then 7 + 11 = <<7+11=18>>18 is the sum of their ages. 10 years from now, Darrell's age will be 18 + 10 = <<18+10=28>>28, and Allen's age will be 11 + 10 = <<11+10=21>>21.

 Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes, which is 20% of the total time.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored 4 + (4 * 25%) = 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 points in the second 20 minutes.  The total points he scored are 4 + 14 = <<4+14=18>>18 points.

 Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, which is 20% of the total time.  In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored 4 + (4 * 25%) = 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 points in the second 20 minutes.  The total points he scored are 4 + 14 = <<4+14=18>>18 points.

18

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 
To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points. 
To do this, we can multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). 
This gives us 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 1 point. 
To find out how many points he scored in total, we add the points he scored in both 20-minute periods: 
4 + 1 = 5

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, which is 20% of the total time.  In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored 4 + (4 * 25%) = 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 points in the second 20 minutes.  The total points he scored are 4 + 14 = <<4+14=18>>18 points.

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which gives him $15 * 13 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs him $20 * 8 = $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he spent $195 - $165 = $30.
Answer:
John still has 13 - 3 = 10 lego sets.

First, let’s find out how much money John made from selling the lego sets: 13 sets * $15/set = $195.
Next, let’s find out how much money he spent on the video games: 8 games * $20/game = $160.
Now, we can find out how much money he has left: $195 - $160 = $35.
Since he has $35 left, he still has 35 / $15 = 2.33 lego sets.
Since he can’t have a fraction of a lego set, he still has 2 lego sets.

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which totals $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which totals $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he spent $195 - $165 = $30 on other things.
Answer:
John still has 13 - 30 = 10 lego sets.
________________________________________________________________________________

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which totals $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which totals $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he spent $165, which means he has $195 - $165 = $30 left.
Answer:
30
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find out how much money John has from selling the lego sets: 13 sets * $15/set = $195.
Next, let’s find out how much money he spends on the video games: 8 games * $20/game = $160.
Now, we can find out how much money he has left: $195 - $160 = $35.
Since he has $35 left, he still has 35 / $15 = 2.33 lego sets.
Since he can’t have a fraction of a lego set, he still has 2 lego sets.
Answer:
2

First, we need to find out how many miles he runs in 3 hours. 3 hours is 1/4 of a week, so he runs 1/4 of his weekly distance. 1/4 of 60 miles is 15 miles. 
Next, we need to find out how many miles he runs in 1 hour. Since he runs 3 hours the first day, he runs 3/4 of his weekly distance in 3 hours. 3/4 of 60 miles is 45 miles. 
Since he runs 15 miles in 3 hours, he runs 15 miles / 3 = 5 miles in 1 hour.

['First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.\nNext, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can eat: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.\nSince 100 grams of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to eat by the number of calories per gram: 200 calories / 250 calories/gram = 0.8 grams.\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8\n\nAnswer:\n0.8', 'First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can eat: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.
Since 100 grams of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to eat by the number of calories per gram: 200 calories / 250 calories/gram = 0.8 grams.

Since 100 calories are equal to 80 grams of chips, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to eat by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 80 = 2.5 grams.

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in the bag by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can consume: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.
Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 calories / 250 calories/gram = 0.8 grams.
Answer:
0.8 grams

Answer:
0.8 grams

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories, we can divide our daily calorie target by the number of calories per gram of chips: 2000 / 1250 = 1.6 grams.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=4>>4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = <<20+16+32=72>>72 hours.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = 20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = 16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = 8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = 32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = 72 hours.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

________________________________________________________________________________

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.
