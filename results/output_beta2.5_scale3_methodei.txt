To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. The third glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3, and so on. Therefore, the total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3

40% of the way through the download, Carla has downloaded 200 GB * 0.4 = <<200*0.4=80>>80 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it takes 80 GB / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes to download this portion of the file. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = <<200-80=120>>120 GB in 120 minutes.

First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333.33 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, she downloads 333.33 GB / 2 = 166.67 GB in 166.67 minutes. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 333.33 GB / 2 = 166.67 GB in 166.67 minutes.
Answer:
333.33 GB
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333 GB. Then, let’s calculate how long it takes for Carla to download this portion of the file: 333 GB / 2 GB/minute = 166.5 minutes. Since the restart takes 20 minutes, Carla has to download the entire file again, which takes 166.5 minutes + 20 minutes = 186.5 minutes.
Answer:
186.5

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
40% of the way through the download, Carla has downloaded 80 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it takes 80 GB / 2 = 40 minutes to download this portion of the file. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB in 120 minutes.

Answer:
120

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours:
3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic:
2 hours
During this time, John was not able to drive, so he did not cover any distance.
Next, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour:
0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours:
2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles
Now, we can add up all the distances John drove to find out how far he is from home:
180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles = 365 miles
Answer:
365

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours. During this time, John was not able to drive, so he did not cover any distance.
Next, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour: 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours: 2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles.
Now, we can add up all the distances John drove to find out how far he is from home: 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles = 365 miles.

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours:
3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic:
2 hours
During this time, John was not able to drive, so he did not cover any distance.
Next, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour:
0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours:
2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles
Now, we can add up all the distances John drove to find out how far he is from home:
180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles = 365 miles

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it had 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, so it had 180 * (1 - 0.3) = 126 downloads. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the number of downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

1. The cost of planting the tree is $90.
2. The income from selling the lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.
3. The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3 a year.
4. The net income for the first year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
5. The tree will produce 8 lemons in the second year, which will bring in $12.
6. The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.
7. The net income for the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.
8. The tree will produce 9 lemons in the third year, which will bring in $13.5.
9. The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.
10. The net income for the third year is $13.5 - $3 = $10.5.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16
25% of the remaining: 16 * 0.25 = 4
So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12

Answer:
12
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance: 16 * 25% = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 students (20 - 4) is. 20% of 16 is 0.20 * 16 = 3.2.
Since we can’t have a fraction of a student, we round up to 4 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
12 students / 20 students = 0.6.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
0.6 * 100 = 60%
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students in the remaining classes. Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. This leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students in the hip-hop class. Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can find this by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance: 16 * 25% = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students in the class.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 students - 4 students (contemporary) - 4 students (jazz) = 4 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (4 students / 20 students) * 100 = 20%.

1. The merchant has two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000.
2. The financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month.
3. To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option that will give him the highest profit at the end of the month.
4. If the merchant chooses the jewelry option, he will make a profit of $5,000 * 2.5% = $<<5000*2.5=1250>>1,250.
5. If the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets option, he will make a profit of $8,000 * 1.2% = $<<8000*1.2=960>>960.
6. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets option to maximize his profit at the end of the month.

Answer:
The merchant would make a profit of $960.

First, let’s calculate her weekly salary as a teacher: 50 weeks/year * 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $3500/week.
Next, let’s calculate her weekly salary as a coach: 50 weeks/year * 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $2250/week.
Finally, let’s add her weekly salaries as a teacher and a coach to find her total weekly salary: $3500 + $2250 = $5750/week.
To find her annual salary, multiply her total weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year: $5750/week * 50 weeks/year = $287500/year.

________________________________________________________________________________

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son was born at the age of 23, and Raymond was 25 when his son was born, Raymond's son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

However, since it is not possible to have a negative number of years, we need to reconsider our answer.

Answer:
The answer is not possible.

Answer:
The answer is not possible.

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
Cost per box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?
Answer:
10

Answer:
10
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
Cost of each box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + (5 * $3) + (4 * $1.50) = $25. Then, subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $25 = $25. Finally, divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes ordered: $25 / $8.50 = 3.

Let's call the cost of the boots "x". Then the cost of the two pairs of high heels is x - 5. One pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs 2 \* $33 = $66. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the two pairs of high heels, the cost of the boots is $99 + 5 = $104.
Answer:
The boots cost $104.

30 more gold coins than silver coins means that the number of gold coins is the number of silver coins plus 30. Let x be the number of silver coins. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110. Solving for x, we get x = 20. Therefore, Gretchen has 20 gold coins.

 Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts.  The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs 5.00 / 4 = $<<5.00/4=1.25>>1.25.  Over 60 yogurts, Terry will spend 60 * 1.25 = $<<60*1.25=75>>75.

________________________________________________________________________________

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which totals $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which totals $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he spent $165 and has $30 left.
Answer:
John still has 30 / $15 = 2 lego sets.
________________________________________________________________________________

First, John sells his lego sets. 13 sets x $15/set = $195.
Next, John buys video games. 8 games x $20/game = $160.
John has $5 left.
So, John has $195 - $160 = $35.

Answer:
John still has 35 lego sets.

1. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 2. The gold javelin can reach a distance of 400 feet when Polly is not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet. 4. Since the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 - 1200 = <<1000-1200=-200>>-200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
-200 feet

1. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 2. The gold javelin can reach a distance of 400 feet when Polly is not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. 4. Since the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
-200 feet

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.
To find out how many grams of chips we can eat, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 calories / (250 calories/gram) = 0.8 grams.

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g is 5 * 250 = 1250 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to subtract 1800 from 2000 to find out how many calories we need to consume to stay within our daily calorie target. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=4>>4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = <<20+16+32=72>>72 hours.

First, let’s find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at work: 220 cups of coffee x 1 note/cup = 220 notes.
Next, let’s subtract the 80 notes she put in her purse and the 23 notes she had left over from the 220 notes she used at work: 220 - 80 - 23 = 177.
Finally, let’s add the 177 notes she used at work to the 80 notes she put in her purse: 80 + 177 = 257.
Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can subtract 23 from 257 to find out how many notes were in the package: 257 - 23 = 234.
Answer:
234

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at work: 220 cups of coffee * 1 note/cup = 220 notes. Then, let’s find out how many Post-it notes she had after she purchased the package: 80 notes (from her purse) + 23 notes (from the package) = 103 notes. Finally, let’s find out how many Post-it notes were in the package: 103 notes (total) - 80 notes (from her purse) = 23 notes.
Answer:
23
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at work: 220 cups of coffee x 1 note/cup = 220 notes.
Next, let’s subtract the 80 notes she put in her purse and the 23 notes she had left over from the 220 notes she used at work: 220 - 80 - 23 = 177.
Finally, let’s add the 177 notes she used at work to the 80 notes she put in her purse and the 23 notes she had left over: 80 + 23 + 177 = 280.
Since she had 23 notes left over, we can subtract 23 from 280 to find out how many notes were in the package: 280 - 23 = 257.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

First, let’s find out how many blue ties John bought: 200 / 40 = 5. 

Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. 

The cost of the blue ties is 5 * 40 = $200. 

Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, they cost 200 * 1.5 = $300. 

So, John spent a total of 200 + 300 = $500 on ties.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he spent $200 on blue ties, he spent 2 * $200 = $400 on red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each.
Answer:
$400
________________________________________________________________________________

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, let’s find out how many blue ties John bought:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties * (1 + 50%)
Cost of red ties = $40 * (1 + 0.5)
Cost of red ties = $60

Now, let’s find out how much John spent on ties:

Total cost of ties = (Number of blue ties * Cost per blue tie) + (Number of red ties * Cost of red ties)
Total cost of ties = (5 * $40) + (10 * $60)
Total cost of ties = $200 + $600
________________________________________________________________________________

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he spent $200 on blue ties, he spent 2 * $200 = $400 on red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. That means 120 * (3/4) = 90 units are occupied. To find the number of unoccupied units, subtract the occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

[rank0]:[W1021 15:04:42.762219823 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
