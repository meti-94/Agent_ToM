To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so she has given a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. To find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, she needs to subtract the amount of feed she has already given from the total amount of feed her chickens need: 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed.

Answer:
20

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. The third glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3, and so on. Therefore, the total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so every second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. 16 glasses have 8 full-priced glasses and 8 second-priced glasses, so 8 full-priced glasses cost $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40 and 8 second-priced glasses cost $3 * 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.

Answer:
$40 + $24 = $<<40+24=64>>64

['First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333 GB. Then, let’s calculate how long it takes for Carla to download this portion of the file: 333 GB / 2 GB/minute = 166.5 minutes. Since Carla has to restart, we need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates.

First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333 GB. Then, let’s calculate how long it takes for Carla to download this portion of the file: 333 GB / 2 GB/minute = 166.5 minutes. Since Carla has to restart, we need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates. So, the total time to download the file is 166.5 + 20 = 186.5 minutes.

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours:
3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic:
2 hours = 2 hours
Then, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour:
0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours:
2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles
So, John is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours:
3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic:
2 hours = 2 hours
Then, let’s calculate how far John drove in the next half-hour:
0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles
Finally, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 2 hours:
2 hours * 80 mph = 160 miles
So, John is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

To find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to divide the cost of planting the tree by the net income: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

Let’s start with the green house. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, so she sold 5 / 3 = 1.67. Since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 2 vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 1 vacuum cleaner. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 1 / 2 = 0.5. Again, since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner. This leaves her with 0 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 (20 - 4) is. 20% of 16 is 0.20 * 16 = 3.2
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to 3 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Since the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 - 3 = 13
Therefore, 13 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.
13 / 20 = 0.65
0.65 * 100 = 65%

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16
25% of the remaining: 16 * 25/100 = 4
So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12

1. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
2. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.
3. So, she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<35*50=1750>>1750 hours/year as a teacher.
4. She works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<15*50=750>>750 hours/year as a coach.
5. Therefore, her annual salary is 1750 hours/year * $20/hour + 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $<<1750*20+750*30=105000>>105,000.

$105,000

1. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
2. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.
3. So, she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year as a teacher.
4. She works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year as a coach.
5. Therefore, her annual salary is 1750 hours/year * $20/hour + 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $105,000.

Answer:
$105,000

________________________________________________________________________________

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when he had his son. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when he had his son.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he was 25 when Samantha was born, Raymond's son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son was born at the age of 23, and Raymond was 25 when his son was born, Raymond's son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

However, since we cannot have a negative number of years, we need to adjust our answer. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 25 - 2 = 23 years ago.

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

However, since we cannot have a negative number of years, we need to adjust our answer. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
Cost per box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2
Answer:

7:11 is the ratio of their ages. If their total age now is 162, then 7 + 11 = <<7+11=18>>18 is the sum of their ages. 10 years from now, their combined age will be 18 + 10 = <<18+10=28>>28. Since Allen is older than Darrell, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 28 - 10 = <<28-10=18>>18.

7:11 is the ratio of their ages. If their total age now is 162, then 7 + 11 = 18 is the sum of their ages. 10 years from now, their combined age will be 18 + 10 = 28. Since Allen is older than Darrell, Allen’s age 10 years from now will be 28 - 10 = 18.

________________________________________________________________________________

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which gives him $15 * 13 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs him $20 * 8 = $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he spent $195 - $165 = $30.
Answer:
John still has 13 - 3 = 10 lego sets.
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find out how much money John made from selling the lego sets: 13 sets * $15/set = $195.
Next, let’s find out how much money he spent on the video games: 8 games * $20/game = $160.
Now, we can find out how much money he has left: $195 - $160 = $35.
Since he has $35 left, he still has 35 / $15 = 2.33
Since he can’t have a fraction of a lego set, he still has 2 lego sets.
Answer:
2

Answer:
10
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many miles John runs in 3 hours. 
To do this, we can use the formula:
distance = speed x time
We know that John runs 60 miles a week, so his speed is 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles/day.
We also know that John runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. 
So, the first day, he runs 20 miles/day x 3 hours = 60 miles.
The other two days, he runs 20 miles/day x 1.5 hours = 30 miles.
Therefore, John runs 60 miles + 30 miles = 90 miles in 3 days.
To find out how fast he runs, we can use the formula:
speed = distance / time
We know that John runs 90 miles in 3 days, so his speed is 90 miles / 3 days = 30 miles/day.
Answer:
30
________________________________________________________________________________

He runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  So, he runs 3 + 3/2 + 3/4 = 10.5 hours a week.  To find out how fast he runs, divide the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 10.5 hours = 5.71 miles per hour.

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet. 4. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Since Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 1200 feet, she can stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
1200 feet

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. 4. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Since Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 1200 feet, she can stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
1200 feet

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. To stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories, we need to eat 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

Answer:
0.8 grams

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000. To do this, we can subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to eat by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.
Answer:
0.8

Answer:
0.8

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. To stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories, we need to eat 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to eat by the number of calories per gram of chips: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how much beeswax he needs to make 20 candles. To do this, we divide the number of candles by the number of candles one pound of beeswax can make: 20 / 10 = 2 pounds. 
Next, we need to find out how much it costs him to make 2 pounds of beeswax. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks by 2: 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.
Then we need to find out how much money he will make from selling 20 candles. To do this, we multiply the number of candles by the price per candle: 20 x $2.00 = $40.00
Finally, we subtract the cost of making the beeswax from the money he will make from selling the candles to find his net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

________________________________________________________________________________

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.
Answer:
30
________________________________________________________________________________

Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, 3/4 of the 15 floors are occupied.

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. 3/4 of the building is occupied, so 3/4 of the units are occupied. 120 * (3/4) = 90 occupied units. 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied units.

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90 units. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.
