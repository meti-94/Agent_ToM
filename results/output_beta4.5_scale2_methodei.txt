To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $<<16*5=80>>80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $<<16*0.6=9.6>>9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $<<80+9.6=89.6>>89.6.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $89.6.

89.6

['First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333.33 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it takes 333.33 / 2 = 166.67 minutes to download this portion. Then, the restart takes 20 minutes, so the total time before the restart is 166.67 + 20 = 186.67 minutes. Since she has to restart from the beginning, the total time to download the file is 186.67 * 2 = 373.34 minutes.\nAnswer:\n373.34', 'First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333 GB.

First, let’s calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart: 200 GB / 0.6 = 333.33 GB. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it takes 333.33 / 2 = 166.67 minutes to download this portion. Then, the restart takes 20 minutes, so the total time before the restart is 166.67 + 20 = 186.67 minutes. Since she has to restart from the beginning, the total time to download the file is 186.67 * 2 = 373.34 minutes.

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (in traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 1.5 hours: 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, John is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

First, we need to find Brinley's average after removing the lowest score. We can do this by adding up all her scores and then dividing by 5 (since she has 5 scores). 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448. 448 / 5 = 89.6. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, Brinley can remove the 71. This leaves her with an average of 89.6 - 71 = 18.6. To get an average of 93, she needs to add 5.4 to her average. To find the score she needs on the sixth test, we can add 5.4 to her average: 89.6 + 5.4 = 95.0.

['First, let’s calculate the cost of planting the tree: $90. Next, let’s calculate the income from selling the lemons. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. So, the income from selling the lemons is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the net income from the tree is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. To find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to divide the cost of planting the tree by the net income: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.\nAnswer:\n12', 'First, let’s calculate the cost of planting the tree: $90. Next, let’s calculate the income from selling the lemons: 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the net income for the first year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. For the second year, the tree will produce 8 lemons, so the income will be 8 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $12. The cost for the second year will be $3. So, the net income for the second year will be $12 - $3 = $9. For the third year, the tree will produce 9 lemons, so the income will be 9 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $13.5. The cost for the third year will be $3. So, the net income for the third year will be $13.5 - $3 = $10.5. Therefore, it will take 3 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.\nAnswer:\n3', 'First, let’s calculate the cost of planting the tree: $90.

For the third year, the tree will produce 9 lemons, which will bring in $13.5. So, the net income for the third year is $13.5 - $3 = $10.5. Therefore, it will take 3 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.\nAnswer:\n3', 'Answer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:'] [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5]

First, let’s calculate the cost of planting the tree: $90. Next, let’s calculate the income from selling the lemons. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. So, the income from selling the lemons is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the net income from the tree is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. To find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to divide the cost of planting the tree by the net income: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

For the second year, the tree will produce 8 lemons, so the income will be 8 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $12. The cost for the second year will be $3. So, the net income for the second year will be $12 - $3 = $9. For the third year, the tree will produce 9 lemons, so the income will be 9 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $13.5. The cost for the third year will be $3. So, the net income for the third year will be $13.5 - $3 = $10.5. Therefore, it will take 3 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.
Answer:
60%

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students in the remaining classes. Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. This leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students in the hip-hop class. Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.
Answer:
60%
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. This means that 12 students did not enroll in jazz dance.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Since 12 students did not enroll in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance, this means that 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. (12 / 20) \* 100 = 60%.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students, which means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance. 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students, which means that 12 students did not enroll in jazz dance. Therefore, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. (12 / 20) \* 100% = 60%.

The merchant has two options: 1) buy jewelry worth $5,000 and 2) buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000. Let’s calculate the profit for each option: 
Option 1:
The value of the jewelry after 1 month will be $5,000 * (1 + 2.5%) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125.
The profit for this option is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.
Option 2:
The value of the electronic gadgets after 1 month will be $8,000 * (1 + 1.2%) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,080.
The profit for this option is $8,080 - $8,000 = $80.
Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose option 2, which will give him a profit of $80.

Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is 4 miles/hour. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles/hour. She already walked 4 miles at 4 miles/hour, so she has 12 - 4 = 8 miles left to walk. To walk 8 miles in 2 hours, her speed needs to be 8 miles / 2 hours = 4 miles/hour.
Answer:
4

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
Cost per box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2
Answer:
2
________________________________________________________________________________

Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?
Answer:
Marie ordered 50 - 12 - 3 \* 1.5 - 4 \* 1.5 = 20.50 / 8.50 = 2.40

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
162 is the sum of Darrell’s and Allen’s ages. We know that their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. So, we can write the equation x/y = 7/11, where x is Darrell’s age and y is Allen’s age. We also know that x + y = 162. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the first equation by y: x = (7/11)y. Then we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation: (7/11)y + y = 162. Solving for y, we get y = 44. To find Allen’s age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 44 + 10 = 54.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
162 is the sum of Darrell’s and Allen’s ages. We know that their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. So, we can write the equation x/y = 7/11, where x is Darrell’s age and y is Allen’s age. We also know that x + y = 162. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the first equation by y: x = (7/11)y. Then we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation: (7/11)y + y = 162. Solving for y, we get y = 44. To find Allen’s age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 44 + 10 = 54.

Answer:
54

First, we need to find out how many miles John runs in 3 hours. 3 hours is half of the total time he runs, so he runs 3/2 miles in 3 hours. 
Next, we need to find out how many miles he runs in 1 hour. Since he runs 3/2 miles in 3 hours, he runs 3/2 miles in 1 hour.
Since he runs 3 days a week, he runs 3 miles in 1 day.
Therefore, John runs 3 miles in 1 hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run 4 times as far in the same amount of time. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can walk at 3/4 of that speed, which is 3/4 * 3 = 2.5 miles per hour. In six hours, she can walk 6 hours * 2.5 miles/hour = 15 miles. She can run 6 hours / 4 = 1.5 hours. In 1.5 hours, she can run 1.5 hours * 4 = 6 miles. So, in six hours, she can travel 15 miles + 6 miles = 21 miles.

If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will travel 1/3 of the distance running and 2/3 of the distance walking. So, she will travel 1/3 + 2/3 = 5/6 of the distance in six hours.
Answer:
5/6
________________________________________________________________________________

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run at 4 * 3 = 12 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running, she will run for 12 / 3 = 4 hours. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she will walk for 4 / 2 = 2 hours. In six hours, she will run for 4 hours and walk for 2 hours. So, she will travel 4 + 2 = 6 miles in six hours.
Answer:
6
________________________________________________________________________________

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run 4 times as far in the same amount of time. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can skip 3/4 of the distance in the same amount of time. If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will travel 1/3 of the distance running and 2/3 of the distance walking. So, she will travel 1/3 + 2/3 = 5/3 of the distance in six hours.

5/3

________________________________________________________________________________

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so she can run 4 times as far in the same amount of time. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can walk at 3/4 of that speed, which is 3/4 * 3 = 2.5 miles per hour. In six hours, she can walk 6 hours * 2.5 miles/hour = 15 miles. She can run 6 hours / 4 = 1.5 hours. In 1.5 hours, she can run 1.5 hours * 4 = 6 miles. So, in six hours, she can travel 15 miles + 6 miles = 21 miles.

Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet. 4. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = <<1200-1000=200>>200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
200 feet

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. 4. The dragon’s flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon’s flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
200 feet

['First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.\nNext, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories.

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
