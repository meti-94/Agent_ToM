To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $<<16*5=80>>80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $<<16*0.6=9.6>>9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $<<80+9.6=89.6>>89.6.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so the total cost is 16 * $5 = $<<16*5=80>>80. For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the price, so the cost of the 16th glass is 16 * 0.6 = $<<16*0.6=9.6>>9.6. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $9.6 = $<<80+9.6=89.6>>89.6.

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (in traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 1.5 hours: 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, John is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
Next, let’s calculate how long John was stuck in traffic: 2 hours.
After that, let’s calculate how long John drove at 30 mph: 0.5 hours.
Finally, let’s calculate how long John drove at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (in traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
Now, let’s calculate how far John drove in the remaining 1.5 hours: 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, John is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, so it had 180 - (180 * 0.3) = 126 downloads. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, add the number of downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
Answer:
366

This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 1 vacuum cleaner. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 1 / 2 = 0.5. Again, since she can’t sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we’ll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner. This leaves her with 0 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

5

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance: 16 * 25% = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

Answer:
The first train covers 80 miles on the first day and 150 miles on the second day, for a total of 230 miles. The second train covers 80 miles on the first day and 150 miles on the second day, for a total of 230 miles.
Answer:
230
________________________________________________________________________________

The first train travels westward for 80 miles, and the next day it travels northwards for 150 miles. So, the total distance covered by the first train in two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles. The second train travels westward for 80 miles, and the next day it travels northwards for 150 miles. So, the total distance covered by the second train in two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.
Answer:
230

Answer:
$105,000
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s calculate her weekly salary as a teacher: 50 weeks/year * 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $3500/week.
Next, let’s calculate her weekly salary as a coach: 50 weeks/year * 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $2250/week.
Finally, let’s add her weekly salaries as a teacher and a coach to find her total weekly salary: $3500 + $2250 = $5750/week.
To find her annual salary, multiply her total weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year: $5750/week * 50 weeks/year = $287500/year.
Answer:
$287500

________________________________________________________________________________

Answer:
Marie ordered 50 - (12 + 3 \* 5 + 1.50 \* 4) = 50 - 27.50 = 22.50 / 8.50 = 2.67

Answer:
Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
Cost per box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2
Answer:
2
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 * $1.50/apple = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount paid: $50
Cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box to find the number of boxes ordered:
Cost per box: $8.50
Number of boxes ordered: $17 / $8.50 = 2
Answer:
2
________________________________________________________________________________

Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?
Answer:
Marie ordered 50 - 12 - 3 \* 1.5 - 4 \* 1.5 = 10.5
Since Marie ordered a whole number of boxes, she ordered 11 boxes of pizza.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
7:11 is the ratio of their ages. If their total age now is 162, then Darrell's age is 7/11 of 162, which is 121.43. Allen's age is 11/11 of 162, which is 145.46. In 10 years, Darrell's age will be 121.43 + 10 = <<121.43+10=131.43>>131.43, and Allen's age will be 145.46 + 10 = <<145.46+10=155.46>>155.46.

Answer:
131.43 and 155.46

Let x be Darrell's age and y be Allen's age. We know that x/y = 7/11. We also know that x + y = 162. We want to find y 10 years from now, which is y + 10. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for y: (x + y) = 162. We can substitute x/y = 7/11 into the equation: x + y = 162. We can solve for x: x = 162 - y. We can substitute x = 162 - y into the first equation: (162 - y) + y = 162. We can solve for y: y = 162. We can substitute y = 162 into the equation x = 162 - y: x = 162 - 162. We can substitute x = 162 - y into the first equation: (162 - y) + y = 162. We can solve for y: y = 162. We can substitute y = 162 into the equation x = 162 - y: x = 162 - 162. We can substitute x = 162 - y into the first equation: (1

7:11 is the ratio of their ages. If their total age now is 162, then Darrell’s age is 7/11 of 162, which is 121.43. Allen’s age is 11/11 of 162, which is 145.46. In 10 years, Darrell’s age will be 121.43 + 10 = 131.43, and Allen’s age will be 145.46 + 10 = 155.46.

Answer:
131.43 and 155.46

________________________________________________________________________________

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  So, he scored 4 * 1.25 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored a total of 4 + 5 = 9 points.

________________________________________________________________________________

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 
To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points: 
25% of 4 = (25/100) * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 1 point.
To find out how many points he scored in total, we add the points he scored in both 20 minutes:
4 + 1 = 5 points.

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet. 4. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1000 - 1200 = <<1000-1200=-200>>-200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
-200 feet

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. 4. The dragon’s flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon’s flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Answer:
-200 feet

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can consume: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.
Answer:
0.8

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in the bag by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 * 250 = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
To find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram of chips: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g of chips is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can consume: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target, we need to divide the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
