To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, so the second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. The third glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3, and so on. The total cost of the 16 glasses is $80 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $

16 glasses cost $5 each, so 16 glasses cost $5 * 16 = $<<5*16=80>>80. For every second glass, the price is 60% of the price of the first glass, so the price of the second glass is $5 * 0.6 = $<<5*0.6=3>>3. For every third glass, the price is 60% of the price of the second glass, so the price of the third glass is $3 * 0.6 = $<<3*0.6=1.8>>1.8. For every fourth glass, the price is 60% of the price of the third glass, so the price of the fourth glass is $1.8 * 0.6 = $<<1.8*0.6=1.08>>1.08. For every fifth glass, the price is 60% of the price of the fourth glass, so the price of the fifth glass is $1.08 * 0.6 = $<<1.08*0.6=0.648>>0.648. For every sixth glass, the price is 60% of the price of the fifth glass, so the price of the sixth glass is $0.648 * 0.6 = $<<0.64

First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. 200 GB / 0.6 = 333.33 GB.
Next, we need to find out how long it takes Carla to download 333.33 GB. 333.33 GB / 2 GB/minute = 166.67 minutes.
Since Carla has to restart the download, we need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates.

200 GB / 0.6 = 333 GB. 333 GB / 2 GB/minute = 166.5 minutes. Since Carla has to restart the download, we need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates. So, the total time for the first download is 166.5 + 20 = 186.5 minutes.

186.5

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 miles.
2. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. So, he covers 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 hours at a speed of 80 mph.
3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = <<0.5*30=15>>15 miles.
4. In total, John covers 180 + 15 = <<180+15=195>>195 miles.

Answer:
John is 195 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
2. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 downloads.
3. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% in the second month, so it was 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads.
4. The total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366 downloads.

366

Let's start with the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the green house. If she sold a third of them, she had 5/3 = 1.67. Since she can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round up to 2 vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 3 vacuum cleaners. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 1 vacuum cleaner. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 1/2 = 0.5. Again, since she can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round up to 1 vacuum cleaner. This leaves her with 0 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of 20 = <<20*.1=2>>2 students. 25% of the remaining 18 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of 18 = <<25*.1=4.5>>4.5 students. The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is 20 - 2 - 4.5 = <<20-2-4.5=13.5>>13.5 students.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. This means that 16 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.
Since the remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 (20 - 4) is.
0.20 * 16 = 3.2
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to 4.
So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.
The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance.
Since 20% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we need to find out what 20% of 16 students (20 - 4) is. 20% of 16 is 0.20 * 16 = 3.2.
Since we can’t have a fraction of a student, we round up to 4 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%
Answer:
60%

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

1. The merchant has two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000.
2. The financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month.
3. To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option that will give him the highest profit at the end of the month.
4. To calculate the profit, we need to find the difference between the final value of the item and the initial value of the item.
5. For the jewelry, the final value will be $5,000 * 1.025 = $<<5000*1.025=5125>>5,125.
6. For the electronic gadgets, the final value will be $8,000 * 1.012 = $<<8000*1.012=8096>>8,096.
7. Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option that will give him the highest profit at the end of the month.
8. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, and he will make a profit of $8,096 - $8

1. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
2. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.
3. So, she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<35*50=1750>>1750 hours/year as a teacher.
4. She works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<15*50=750>>750 hours/year as a coach.
5. Therefore, her annual salary is 1750 hours/year * $20/hour + 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $<<1750*20+750*30=105000>>105,000.

Answer:
$105,000

First, I need to find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, I can multiply 10 by 2/3 = 10/3 = 3.33 liters.
Next, I need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, I can multiply 15 by 3/5 = 9 liters.
Now, I need to find the total amount of water in the two drinks. I can add the amount of water in the orange drink to the amount of water in the pineapple drink: 3.33 + 9 = 12.33 liters.
Since I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 12.33 - 1 = 11.33 liters.

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink is 5.66 + 9 = 14.66 liters.
Answer:
14.66

Answer:

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the amount of water in the orange drink: 10 liters * (2/3) = 10/3 = 3.33 liters.
Next, let’s find the amount of water in the pineapple drink: 15 liters * (3/5) = 15/5 = 3 liters.
Now, let’s add the amount of water in the orange drink to the amount of water in the pineapple drink: 3.33 liters + 3 liters = 6.33 liters.
Since you spilled one liter of the orange drink, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.33 liters - 1 liter = 5.33 liters.
Answer:
5.33
________________________________________________________________________________

First, I have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. So, 10 / (2/3) = 15 liters of water. Then, I have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. So, 15 / (3/5) = 15 liters of water. The total amount of water is 15 + 15 = 30 liters. After spilling one liter of the orange drink, I have 24 liters of water left.

10 liters of orange drink is two-thirds water, so 2/3 of 10 liters is 6.67 liters of water. 15 liters of pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so 3/5 of 15 liters is 9 liters of water. The total water in the 25 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 years old when his son was born.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son was born at the age of 23, and Raymond was 25 years old, Raymond's son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

________________________________________________________________________________

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when he had his son. Since he was 6 years older than Samantha, he was 31 - 6 = 25.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and he is now 25, his son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is now 31, Raymond was born 31 - 6 = 25.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, his son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

However, since a negative number of years doesn't make sense, we need to reconsider our answer.

We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is now 31, Raymond was born 31 - 6 = 25.

Let x be the cost of the boots. Then the cost of the two pairs of high heels is x - 5. The cost of one pair of heels is $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the other pair of heels is 2 \* $33 = $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is x - 5 = x - $38. Since the boots cost $x, the total cost of the boots and the two pairs of high heels is x + (x - $38) = 2x - $33.

 Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes, which is 20% of the total time.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored 4 + (4 * 25%) = 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 points in the second 20 minutes.  The total points he scored are 4 + 14 = <<4+14=18>>18 points.

 Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes, which is 20% of the total time.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.  Therefore, he scored 4 + (4 * 25%) = 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 points in the second 20 minutes.  The total points he scored are 4 + 14 = <<4+14=18>>18 points.

18

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

First, John sells his 13 lego sets for $15 each. This gives him 13 * $15 = $195.
Next, John buys 8 video games for $20 each. This costs him 8 * $20 = $160.
After buying the video games, John has $5 left.
So, John has $195 - $160 = $35.

Answer:
John still has 35 lego sets.

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

First, John sells his 13 lego sets for $15 each. This gives him 13 \* $15 = $195.
Next, John buys 8 video games for $20 each. This costs him 8 \* $20 = $160.
After buying the video games, John has $5 left.
So, John has $195 - $160 = $35.

________________________________________________________________________________

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  So, he runs 3 + 3/2 + 3/4 = 10.5 hours a week.  To find his speed, divide the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 10.5 hours = 5.71 miles per hour.

________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many miles John runs in 3 hours. 
To do this, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed x Time
We know that John runs 60 miles in 3 hours, so:
60 = 60 x 3
Therefore, John runs 20 miles per hour.

1. Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. 2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 3. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet. 4. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. 5. Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1000 - 1200 = <<1000-1200=-200>>-200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

-200

['First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: 250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.\nNext, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000 calories.

300g of chips has 5 servings, so the total number of calories in 300g is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. We have already consumed 1800 calories, so we need to find out how many more calories we can consume: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Since 1 gram of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to consume by the number of calories per gram: 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

Answer:
0.8 grams

First, we need to find out how many pounds of beeswax he needs to make 20 candles. 20 candles / 10 candles/pound = 2 pounds of beeswax. 2 pounds of beeswax * $10.00/pound = $20.00 in supplies. 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00 in sales. To find his net profit, subtract the supplies from the sales: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

2 pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles. The cost of the supplies is 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks, which costs $20.00. The revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 candles sold at $2.00 each, which is $40.00. Finally, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the cost of the supplies from the revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

$20.00

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=4>>4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = <<20+16+32=72>>72 hours.

72

Candice put 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used 220 Post-it notes. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let’s assume that the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained x Post-it notes.

Candice used 220 Post-it notes, which means she had 80 + 220 - x Post-it notes left.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes left, we can set up the following equation:

80 + 220 - x = 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 80 + 220 - 23

x = 217

Answer:

The package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 217 Post-it notes.

Answer:

217

Candice put 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used 220 Post-it notes. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let’s call the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased x.

We can set up the following equation:

80 + x = 220 + 23

Solving for x:

x = 220 + 23 - 80

x = 137

________________________________________________________________________________

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.
