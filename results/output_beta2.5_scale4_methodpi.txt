To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 miles.
2. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. 
3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = <<0.5*30=15>>15 miles.
4. He spends the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph, so he covers 4 - 2 - 0.5 = <<4-2-0.5=1.5>>1.5 hours * 80 = <<1.5*80=120>>120 miles.
5. In total, John covers 180 + 15 + 120 = <<180+15+120=315>>315 miles.

Answer:
315 miles

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = 180 miles.
2. He turns around and drives for 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
4. He spends the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph, so he covers 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours * 80 = 120 miles.
5. In total, John covers 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

Answer:
315 miles

3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 * $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 * $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 * $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330. The total cost is $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=704>>704.

$704

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
The remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance: 16 * 25/100 = 4 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.
To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can use the formula:
(Number of students in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

1. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
2. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.
3. So, she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<35*50=1750>>1750 hours/year as a teacher.
4. She works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = <<15*50=750>>750 hours/year as a coach.
5. Therefore, her annual salary is 1750 hours/year * $20/hour + 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $<<1750*20+750*30=105000>>105,000.

Answer:
$105,000

Since it is two-thirds water, I can find the amount of water by multiplying 10 by 2/3 = 10/3 = 3.33 liters.\nThen, I need to find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, I can find the amount of water by multiplying 15 by 3/5 = 9 liters.\nNow, I need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink. I can find the total by adding the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 3.33 + 9 = 12.33 liters.\nSince I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I need to subtract that from the total: 12.33 - 1 = 11.33 liters.\nAnswer:\n11.33\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:', 'First, I have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water.

First, I need to find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, I can find the amount of water by multiplying 10 by 2/3 = 10/3 = 3.33 liters.
Then, I need to find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, I can find the amount of water by multiplying 15 by 3/5 = 9 liters.
Now, I need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink. I can find the total by adding the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 3.33 + 9 = 12.33 liters.
Since I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I need to subtract that from the total: 12.33 - 1 = 11.33 liters.

10 liters of orange drink is two-thirds water, so 2/3 of 10 liters is 6.67 liters of water. 15 liters of pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so 3/5 of 15 liters is 9 liters of water. The total water in the 25 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. Since I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I need to subtract that from the total: 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son was born at the age of 23, and Raymond was 25 when his son was born, Raymond's son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

However, since we cannot have a negative answer, we need to adjust our calculation. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. Samantha is now 31.

First, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son was born at the age of 23, and Raymond was 25 when his son was born, Raymond's son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.

However, since we cannot have a negative number of years, we need to adjust our answer. Since Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when his son was born.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 25 - 2 = 23 years ago.

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
The chicken meal costs $12.
The 5 packs of milk cost 5 x $3 = $15.
The 4 apples cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.
Now, let’s subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Marie paid a total of $50.
The cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33.
The cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.
Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered:
The cost of one box of pizza is $8.50.
The cost of the pizza is $17.
Marie ordered $17 / $8.50 = 2

________________________________________________________________________________

First, let’s find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
Chicken meal: $12
Milk: 5 packs x $3/pack = $15
Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Now, let’s subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:
Total amount Marie paid: $50
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $33
Cost of pizza: $50 - $33 = $17
Now, let’s divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box to find out how many boxes Marie ordered:
Cost of each box: $8.50
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2
Answer:
Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

30 more gold coins than silver coins means that the number of gold coins is the number of silver coins plus 30. Let x be the number of silver coins. Then the number of gold coins is x + 30. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110. Solving for x, we get x = 20. So, Gretchen has 20 gold coins.

30 more gold coins than silver coins means that the number of gold coins is the number of silver coins plus 30. Let x be the number of silver coins. Then the number of gold coins is x + 30. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110. Solving for x, we get x = 20. So, Gretchen has 20 gold coins.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 40 + 5 = 45 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 45 - 2 = 43 jewels.
Answer:
43
________________________________________________________________________________

First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has:
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
Aaron has 5 + (1/2) * 40 = 5 + 20 = 25 jewels.
Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that he has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So,
Aaron = (1/2) * Raymond + 5
Aaron = (1/2) * 40 + 5
Aaron = 20 + 5
Aaron = 25

Now we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So,
Siobhan = Aaron - 2
Siobhan = 25 - 2
Siobhan = 23

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 
To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4:
25% of 4 = (25/100) * 4 = 1
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 1 point.
To find out how many points he scored in total, we add the points he scored in both 20 minutes:
4 + 1 = 5

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 
To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4:
25% of 4 = (25/100) * 4 = 1
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 1 point.
To find out how many points he scored in total, we add the points he scored in both 20 minutes:
4 + 1 = 5
Answer:
5
________________________________________________________________________________

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 
To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we can multiply the number of points he scored in the first 20 minutes by 1.25: 
4 points x 1.25 = 5 points
So, Mike scored a total of 4 + 5 = 9 points.

First, John sells his 13 lego sets for $15 each. This gives him 13 * $15 = $195.
Next, John buys 8 video games for $20 each. This costs him 8 * $20 = $160.
After buying the video games, John has $5 left.
So, John has $195 - $160 = $35.

Answer:
John still has 35 lego sets.

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, which totals $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which totals $160. He has $5 left, which means he spent $160 + $5 = $165. Since he had $195, he must have sold one lego set for $40.
Answer:
12
________________________________________________________________________________

First, John sells his 13 lego sets for $15 each. This gives him 13 * $15 = $195.
Next, John buys 8 video games for $20 each. This costs him 8 * $20 = $160.
After buying the video games, John has $5 left.
So, John has $195 - $160 = $35.

Answer:
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000. To do this, we can subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
Since 100 calories are equal to 100 grams of chips, we can divide the number of calories we need to eat by 100 to find out how many grams of chips we can eat: 200 / 100 = 2 grams.

['First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.\nNext, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000. To do this, we can subtract the number of calories we have already consumed (1800) from our daily calorie target (2000): 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.\nFinally, we can divide the number of calories we need to eat (200) by the number of calories per gram of chips (1250) to find out how many grams of chips we can eat: 200 / 1250 = 0.16 grams.\nAnswer:\n0.16\n\nAnswer:\n0.16', 'First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in 300g of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we can find the total number of calories in 300g by multiplying the number of servings by the number of calories per serving: 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.
Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat to stay within our daily calorie target of 2000. To do this, we can subtract the number of calories we have already consumed (1800) from our daily calorie target (2000): 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
Finally, we can divide the number of calories we need to eat (200) by the number of calories per gram of chips (1250) to find out how many grams of chips we can eat: 200 / 1250 = 0.16 grams.

Since we know that 100 grams of chips contains 250 calories, we can find out how many grams of chips we can eat by dividing the number of calories we need to consume (200) by the number of calories per gram (250): 200 / 250 = 0.8 grams.

First, let’s find out how many pounds of beeswax he needs to make 20 candles: 20 / 10 = 2 pounds. Next, let’s find out how much it costs him to make 2 pounds of beeswax: 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00. Next, let’s find out how much money he makes from selling 20 candles: 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00. Finally, let’s find out his net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.
Answer:
$20.00
________________________________________________________________________________

First, we need to find out how much beeswax he needs to make 20 candles. 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. 
Next, we need to find out how much he spends on supplies. 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.
Then we need to find out how much he makes from selling the candles. 20 candles sold at $2.00 each make $40.00.
To find his net profit, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the amount he makes from selling the candles. $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00.

First, we need to find out how much beeswax he needs to make 20 candles. 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. 
Next, we need to find out how much he spends on supplies. 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00.
Then we need to find out how much he makes from selling the candles. 20 candles sold at $2.00 each = $40.
To find his net profit, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the amount he made from selling the candles. $40 - $10.00 = $30.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=4>>4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = <<20+16+32=72>>72 hours.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = 20 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 4 articles. This took 4 * 4 = 16 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 4 = 8 articles. This took 8 * 4 = 32 hours.
4. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 16 + 32 = 72 hours.

Candice put 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used 220 Post-it notes. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let’s assume that the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained x Post-it notes.

Candice used 220 Post-it notes, which means she had 80 + 220 - x Post-it notes left.

She had 23 Post-it notes left, so we can set up the following equation:

80 + 220 - x = 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 80 + 220 - 23
x = 217

Therefore, the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 217 Post-it notes.

Answer:
217

80 (in her purse) + 220 (at work) = 300

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, the package that she purchased must have contained 300 - 23 = 277 Post-it notes.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

Answer:
30

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90 units. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
