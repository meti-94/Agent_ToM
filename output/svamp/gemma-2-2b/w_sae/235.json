After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202\n1. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after she stopped jogging. So, before she started jogging, she weighed 211 - 62 - 140 = 9 kilograms. Answer: 9\n2. Thought: 1. Let’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. So, she lost 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms in total. 2. Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. So, she weighed 9 + 202 = 211 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 211\n3. Thought: 9 - 62 = -53. 9 - 140 = -131. So, before starting to jog, Jessie weighed 9 + 53 + 131 = 193. Answer: 193\n4. Thought: 9 - 62 = -53. 9 - 140 = -131. So, before starting to jog, Jessie weighed 9 + 53 + 131 = 193. Answer: 193\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week.
