So, 91 - 23 = 68 gives the number of more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.\nAnswer:\n68", "clean_answer": "68", "is_true": true, "reward": 1.0, "cum_rewards": [1.0], "is_terminal": false, "eva_process": [], "is_verified_true": 1, "consistency": 1.0, "prob_score": 0.0, "is_verified": false, "children": [], "weights": [[[0.44575631618499756, 0.44131767749786377, 0.999826967716217, 0.9693768620491028, 0.48109328746795654, 0.10147321224212646, 0.6402233242988586, 0.5108599662780762, 0.08070611953735352, 0.9094439744949341, 0.19022220373153687, 0.18765610456466675, 0.5269715189933777, 0.5153814554214478, 0.14688199758529663]], [[0.8585137724876404, 0.19104981422424316, 0.8510081768035889, 0.5057382583618164, 0.920099139213562, 0.6634960770606995, 0.7140852808952332, 0.47263503074645996, 0.04378610849380493, 0.8376177549362183, 0.14722371101379395, 0.1385434865951538, 0.9826316833496094, 0.7790576815605164, 0.4225847125053406]], [[0.3327869772911072, 0.6584981083869934, 0.6805490851402283, 0.963427722454071, 0.8029226660728455, 0.4066769480705261, 0.8122309446334839, 0.6902469396591187, 0.16626787185668945, 0.9333891272544861, 0.3778305649757385, 0.5386641621589661, 0.5273028612136841, 0.2969977855682373, 0.12915295362472534]], [[0.15079927444458008, 0.2564096450805664, 0.6309441924095154, 0.6868266463279724, 0.7297736406326294, 0.5219538807868958, 0.6521569490432739, 0.0364263653755188, 0.13809359073638916, 0.8087290525436401, 0.3300490379333496, 0.09164178371429443, 0.31188517808914185, 0.7701684236526489, 0.34453141689300537]], [[0.3559553623199463, 0.39072185754776, 0.9575381875038147, 0.015049636363983154, 0.8596694469451904, 0.32205188274383545, 0.5946532487869263, 0.030679404735565186, 0.16205710172653198, 0.9566696286201477, 0.465678334236145, 0.898857593536377, 0.6571823954582214, 0.6800469160079956, 0.5738458037376404]]]}], "weights": [[[0.6147288084030151, 0.6508656740188599, 0.6598707437515259, 0.0, 1.0, 0.08768164366483688, 0.6978055834770203, 0.6342996954917908, 0.8573325872421265, 0.7663769125938416, 0.14737975597381592, 0.1259652078151703, 0.5495345592498779, 0.34457382559776306, 0.3828260004520416]], [[0.6718109846115112, 0.0, 0.3532528281211853, 0.5521602630615234, 0.46807342767715454, 0.3234435021877289, 0.6742650866508484, 0.4908792972564697, 0.3989729583263397, 0.46296536922454834, 1.0, 0.7481760382652283, 0.8315616250038147, 0.6638787984848022, 0.061827391386032104]], [[1.0, 0.533236563205719, 0.0, 0.2208314687013626, 0.16343086957931519, 0.4025270938873291, 0.3686062693595886, 0.7283640503883362, 0.7396169304847717, 0.047803059220314026, 0.37300488352775574, 0.7383518218994141, 0.5788953900337219, 0.4424518942832947, 0.5559491515159607]], [[0.6028463840484619, 0.7291191220283508, 0.5133369565010071, 0.0, 0.19921430945396423, 0.6400051116943359, 0.30952465534210205, 1.0, 0.8996307849884033, 0.7452965378761292, 0.39304375648498535, 0.25169408321380615, 0.12947210669517517, 0.5645892024040222, 0.26984646916389465]], [[0.8931182622909546, 1.0, 0.7984241247177124, 0.2297537475824356, 0.21825625002384186, 0.9558706283569336, 0.307248592376709, 0.2806338369846344, 0.18099132180213928, 0.8089450597763062, 0.30355390906333923, 0.3169505298137665, 0.41167500615119934, 0.258185476064682, 0.0]]]}, {"id": 2, "question": "A book has 3 chapters.
