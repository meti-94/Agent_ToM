To find the number of diet soda minus the number of regular soda plus the number of apples, add the number of apples to the number of diet soda minus the number of regular soda: 54 bottles (diet soda) - 80 bottles (regular soda) + 36 bottles (apples) = -26 bottles + 36 bottles = 10 bottles.  Answer: 10", "36 bottles, Diet soda = 54 bottles, Regular soda = 80 bottles. So, Diet soda - Apples = 54 - 36 = 18 bottles. Regular soda - Apples = 80 - 36 = 44 bottles. So, Diet soda - Regular soda = 54 - 44 = 10 bottles. Therefore, they have 10 more bottles than apples. Answer: 10", "36 bottles of soda. So, 36 bottles of soda - 36 bottles of apple = 0 bottles of soda. Answer: 0", "36 bottles of soda. So, 36 bottles of soda = 1 apple. Therefore, 36 bottles of soda = 36 apples. So, there are 36 apples. Answer: 36", "36 bottles. Diet soda = 54 bottles. Regular soda = 80 bottles. So, there are 36 + 54 = 90 bottles of apples and diet soda. There are 80 bottles of regular soda. So, there are 90 - 80 = 10 more bottles than apples. Answer: 10", "36 bottles of soda = 80 bottles of diet soda = 36 + 80 + 54 = 170 bottles of soda. So, they have 170 - 36 = 134 bottles of soda more than apples. Answer: 134"], "ground_truth": "98"}], "final_result": false}
