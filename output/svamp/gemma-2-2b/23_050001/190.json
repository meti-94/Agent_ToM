Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270\n2. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has a certain number of students, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of classrooms. So, 11,270 ÷ 84 = 133.5. Answer: 1335\n3. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the total number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270\n4. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has 1 teacher, there are 84 teachers. So, the total number of students is 11,270 + 84 = 11,354. Answer: 11,354\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. There are 95 school buses, each with 118 seats. To find the total number of seats (and thus the total number of students, assuming each student occupies one seat), multiply the number of buses by the number of seats per bus: 95 buses × 118 seats per bus = 11210 seats Therefore, there are 11210 students in the school.\n\nAnswer:\n11210\n\nQuestion:\nThe Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey.

After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202\n1. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after she stopped jogging. So, before she started jogging, she weighed 211 - 62 - 140 = 9 kilograms. Answer: 9\n2. Thought: 1. Let’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. So, she lost 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms in total. 2. Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. So, she weighed 9 + 202 = 211 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 211\n3. Thought: 9 - 62 = -53. 9 - 140 = -131. So, before starting to jog, Jessie weighed 9 + 53 + 131 = 193. Answer: 193\n4. Thought: 9 - 62 = -53. 9 - 140 = -131. So, before starting to jog, Jessie weighed 9 + 53 + 131 = 193. Answer: 193\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. The total weight lost is: 62 kg + 140 kg = 202 kg Her current weight is 9 kilograms. To find her weight before she started jogging, add the total weight lost to her current weight: 9 kg + 202 kg = 211 kg\n\nAnswer:\n211\n\nQuestion:\nThe school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270\n1. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270\n2. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has a certain number of students, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of classrooms. So, 11,270 ÷ 84 = 133.5. Answer: 1335\n3. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the total number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270\n4. Thought: 95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has 1 teacher, there are 84 teachers. So, the total number of students is 11,270 + 84 = 11,354. Answer: 11,354\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. There are 95 school buses, each with 118 seats. To find the total number of seats (and thus the total number of students, assuming each student occupies one seat), multiply the number of buses by the number of seats per bus: 95 buses × 118 seats per bus = 11210 seats Therefore, there are 11210 students in the school.\n\nAnswer:\n11210\n\nQuestion:\nThe Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 86 dollars for each t-shirt and 232 dollars for each jersey. 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys were sold. 254 x 86 = 21884 and 43 x 232 = 10016. 10016 - 21884 = -11868. So, a jersey costs 11868 dollars more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11868\n1. Thought: the Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. So, the total amount of money made from t-shirts is 254 x 86 = 21884. The total amount of money made from jerseys is 43 x 232 = 10016. The difference between the two is 21884 - 10016 = 11868. So, the difference is $ 11868. Answer: 11868\n2. Thought: 86 dollars for each t-shirt and 232 dollars for each jersey. 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys were sold. 254 x 86 = 21884 and 43 x 232 = 10016. 10016 - 21884 = -11868. So, a jersey costs 11868 dollars more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11868\n3. Thought: 86 * 254 = 21824. 232 * 43 = 9986. 9986 - 21824 = -11838. So, a jersey costs $11838 more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11838\n4. Thought: 86 * 254 = 21724. 232 * 43 = 9986. 9986 - 21724 = -7200. So, a jersey costs $7200 more than a t-shirt. Answer: 7200\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. The cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt is the difference in their individual prices. Subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey: $232 (jersey) - $86 (t-shirt) = $146 Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.\n\nAnswer:\n146\n\nQuestion:\nAt the arcade Dave had won 19 tickets. If he used 12 to buy some toys and 7 more to buy some clothes How many more tickets did Dave use to buy toys than he did to buy clothes?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 12 - 7 = 5. So, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 19 - 12 = 7 tickets left. Dave used 7 tickets to buy clothes. So, he used 12 - 7 = 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 12 - 7 = 5. So, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes. Answer: 5\n3. Thought: Answer: 5\n4. Thought: Xtra tickets used to buy toys = 12 - 7 = 5 Answer: 5\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets he used for toys than for clothes, subtract the number of tickets used for clothes from those used for toys: 12 tickets (toys) - 7 tickets (clothes) = 5 tickets Therefore, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.\n\nAnswer:\n5\n\nQuestion:\nEmily is making bead necklaces for her 44 friends. She made 26 necklaces and each necklace takes 2 beads. How many beads did Emily have?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 26 necklaces were made. Each necklace takes 2 beads. So, 26 x 2 = 52 beads were used. Answer: 52\n1. Thought: 44 friends, 26 necklaces, 2 beads per necklace. So, 44 - 26 = 18 friends left. 18 friends * 2 beads = 36 beads. Answer: 36\n2. Thought: ayah Let’s think step by step. Emily made 26 necklaces. Each necklace takes 2 beads, so she used 26 x 2 = 52 beads. Answer: 52\n3. Thought: 26 necklaces, each taking 2 beads, means 26 x 2 = 52 beads. Answer: 52\n4. Thought: = 26 necklaces. Each necklace takes 2 beads, so 26 * 2 = 52 beads. Answer: 52\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Emily made 26 necklaces, and each necklace requires 2 beads. To find the total number of beads used, multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace: 26 necklaces × 2 beads per necklace = 52 beads.\n\nAnswer:\n52\n\nQuestion:\nThe Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202\n1. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after she stopped jogging. So, before she started jogging, she weighed 211 - 62 - 140 = 9 kilograms. Answer: 9\n2.
