If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800\n2.

After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.\n\nAnswer:\n800\n  \nQuestion:\nSamantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party.

How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nEach solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections, which is the weight of one section multiplied by the number of sections: 400 * 2000 = 800,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that termites ate is the weight of the wood that was eaten multiplied by the percentage eaten: (30% * 800,000) = (3/10 * 800,000) = (240,000) pounds. So, the weight of the redwood is the weight of the wood that was not eaten: (800,000 - 240,000) = (560,000) pounds. Answer: 560,000\n1. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of the sections multiplied by the number of sections: (400 pounds * 2000 feet) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (400 pounds * 20) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (800 pounds) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (80 pounds) / (foot * foot) = (8 pounds) / (foot). So, the weight of the redwood is (8 pounds) / (foot). Answer: 8\n2. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 feet * 10 feet/foot = 2000 feet.

The weight of one section is 400 pounds, so the weight of the redwood tree is 400 * 2000 = 800,000 pounds. The termites ate 30% of the wood, so the weight of the wood they ate is 30% of the weight of the redwood tree, which is (30/100) * (800,000) = 240,000 pounds. The weight of the redwood tree without the wood eaten by termites is the weight of the redwood tree minus the weight of the wood eaten by termites, which is (800,000 - 240,000) = 560,000 pounds.

If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n1.

If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party.

How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nEach solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections, which is the weight of one section multiplied by the number of sections: 400 * 2000 = 800,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that termites ate is the weight of the wood that was eaten multiplied by the percentage eaten: (30% * 800,000) = (3/10 * 800,000) = (240,000) pounds. So, the weight of the redwood is the weight of the wood that was not eaten: (800,000 - 240,000) = (560,000) pounds.  Answer: 560,000\n1. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 12 = 2400 feet. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of one section is 400 / 12 = 33.33 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections multiplied by the number of sections: (33.33 * 2400) / 12 = (7999.99) / 12 = (7499.99) pounds. Answer: 7499.99\n2.

The weight of the redwood tree is the weight of all the sections multiplied by the number of sections. The number of sections is the height divided by the length of one section, which is 200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections. So, the weight of the redwood tree is 400 * 20 = 8000 pounds. Answer: 8000\n3. Thought: is 200 feet tall, which means it has a height of 200 * 12 = 2400 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of the tree is 400 * 2400 = 960,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that was eaten is 30% * 960,000 = 288,000 pounds. The weight of the tree is the weight of the wood minus the weight of the wood eaten, which is 960,000 - 288,000 = 672,000 pounds. Answer: 672,000\n4.

Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16\n1. Thought: either walking or biking to and from work takes 2 hours + 2 hours = <<2+2=4>>4 hours. Walking to and from work three times a week takes 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours. Riding his bike to and from work twice a week takes 4 hours * 2 times = <<4*2=8>>8 hours. Total hours taken to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 12 hours + 8 hours = <<12+8=20>>20 hours. Answer: 20\n2. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18\n3. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours Total hours per day = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours Total hours per week = 6 hours * 5 days = 30 hours Answer: 30\n4. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work. 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 = 12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours biking. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours commuting each week.\n\nAnswer:\n16\n\nQuestion:\nThe profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800\n2. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.\n\nAnswer:\n800\n  \nQuestion:\nSamantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.

He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party.

How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nEach solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections, which is the weight of one section multiplied by the number of sections: 400 * 2000 = 800,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that termites ate is the weight of the wood that was eaten multiplied by the percentage eaten: (30% * 800,000) = (3/10 * 800,000) = (240,000) pounds. So, the weight of the redwood is the weight of the wood that was not eaten: (800,000 - 240,000) = (560,000) pounds. Answer: 560,000\n1. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of the sections multiplied by the number of sections: (400 pounds * 2000 feet) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (400 pounds * 20) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (800 pounds) / (10 feet * 10 feet) = (80 pounds) / (foot * foot) = (8 pounds) / (foot). So, the weight of the redwood is (8 pounds) / (foot). Answer: 8\n2. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 feet * 10 feet/foot = 2000 feet.

He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nEach solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of each section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections, which is the weight of one section multiplied by the number of sections: 400 * 2000 = 800,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that termites ate is the weight of the wood that was eaten multiplied by the percentage eaten: (30% * 800,000) = (3/10 * 800,000) = (240,000) pounds. So, the weight of the redwood is the weight of the wood that was not eaten: (800,000 - 240,000) = (560,000) pounds.  Answer: 560,000\n1. Thought: is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 12 = 2400 feet. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of one section is 400 / 12 = 33.33 pounds. The weight of the redwood is the weight of all sections multiplied by the number of sections: (33.33 * 2400) / 12 = (7999.99) / 12 = (7499.99) pounds. Answer: 7499.99\n2. Thought: tree is 200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 feet. Each solid section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of one section is 400 pounds. The weight of the redwood tree is the weight of all the sections multiplied by the number of sections. The number of sections is the height divided by the length of one section, which is 200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections. So, the weight of the redwood tree is 400 * 20 = 8000 pounds. Answer: 8000\n3. Thought: is 200 feet tall, which means it has a height of 200 * 12 = 2400 feet. Each solid section weighs 400 pounds, so the weight of the tree is 400 * 2400 = 960,000 pounds. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood that was eaten is 30% * 960,000 = 288,000 pounds. The weight of the tree is the weight of the wood minus the weight of the wood eaten, which is 960,000 - 288,000 = 672,000 pounds. Answer: 672,000\n4. Thought: tree weighs 400 pounds per section, and there are 200 sections. So, the redwood weighs 400 * 200 = 80,000 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this wood, which is (30% * 80,000) = 24,000 pounds. So, the redwood weighs (80,000 - 24,000) = 56,000 pounds. Answer: 56,000\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. ", "output": "200 feet tall, so it has a height of 200 * 10 = 2000 feet.
