If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party.

How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nA treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.

Answer: 514.29\n4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.\n\nAnswer:\n800\n  \nQuestion:\nSamantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nA treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.

If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800\n2.

After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29\n4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000.

How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nA treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.

If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800\n2.

Answer: 514.29\n4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.\n\nAnswer:\n800\n  \nQuestion:\nSamantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5\n2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3\n4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: \n7\n  \nQuestion:\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000\n1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400\n4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.\n\nAnswer:\n400\n  \nQuestion:\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nYour previous answers:\n0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72\n2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72\n4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9\n\nAnalysis:\nLet’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.\n\nAnswer:\n9\n\nQuestion:\nA treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.
